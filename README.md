# Factorio Throughput Analyzer

This repository contains a Factorio 2.0 mod that allows you to select an area of your factory and inspect the throughput of machines, belts and inserters.

The mod itself lives in the `throughput-analyzer` directory and can be copied directly into your Factorio mods folder. See the README in that directory for in-game usage instructions.

## Repository Layout

- `throughput-analyzer/` – the mod files loaded by Factorio
- `plan.md` – high level development roadmap
