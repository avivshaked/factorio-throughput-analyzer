# Porting the Throughput Analyzer Mod

These steps outline how to add the mod from this repository into your local Factorio installation.

## 1. Locate Your Factorio Mods Directory

The mods directory location depends on your platform:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Factorio\mods`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/factorio/mods`
- **Linux**: `~/.factorio/mods`

## 2. Prepare the Mod Folder

1. Inside this repository, the mod files are located in the `throughput-analyzer` folder.
2. Zip this folder (so the archive is named `throughput-analyzer_0.1.0.zip`) or copy the folder directly.
   - Factorio accepts either a zipped mod file or an unpacked folder.

## 3. Install the Mod

1. Copy the zipped archive or the entire folder into your `mods` directory.
2. Restart Factorio if it is running.
3. The game should detect "Throughput Analyzer" in the mods list. Enable it if needed.

## 4. Verify In-Game

1. After enabling the mod, start or load a map.
2. You should see the "Throughput Analyzer" selection tool in your inventory.
3. Use the tool to select an area and view throughput statistics.

That's it! The mod is now available in your game.
